Portfolio Website of Gwen Hawe.

Hi! I’m a 23-year-old queer Greek person with 3 cute cats and my lovely spouse, Riley. Gwen Hawe is my pseudonym and was derived from my given name Karihwénhawe, which means ‘carrier of knowledge’ in Mohawk. In 2021, I graduated with my BA: majoring in Communication Sciences and Disorders and minoring in English and Linguistics from WWU. Go Vikings! 

Taking courses regarding (American, English-speaking and bilingual, hearing and d/Deaf) child development of speech, language, and hearing brought me proof that reading is key to language development. My advice is this: Read books you enjoy, Critique those you don’t, and Always ask questions.

Thank you for reading, and I hope adults and children alike enjoy my debut book
